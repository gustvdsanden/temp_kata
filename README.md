```
yarn start
```

Day 1:
FIDA has lost the code to chess!

With the new world champion Ding Liren kicking Magnus of his throne, some people have been worried about Magnus retaliating.
It now seems that instead of participating in the World Championship, Magnus devoted his time to learning how to hack.
Now that he has stolen the code to our chess engine we need you to get started on creating Chess II (patent pending)

We currently dont have an idea how the whole project will turn out so we will keep you updated whenever we make new decisions about the game.
I think its best you keep your project up to date so we can be quick with creating a new version of chess!

For now we already know we want to keep the board the same as in chess 1, so why dont you get started on creating a nice layout for that.
We will provide you with all the code we have so far!

Let's beat Magnus together!

Day 2:
Hey!

Good to see you have been making progress on the game!

Now that we have a board we can start to make progress on some of the pieces.
We would like you to place 1 of every piece from chess 1 (Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, King and Pawn) onto the board in black and white.
Make sure they are nice and centered on their square, professional players cant handle crooked pieces!

Thanks for taking the time to do this for us for free.
